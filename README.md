# Shape-Based-Game
I designed and implemented an engaging educational game tailored for students in classes 6 to 12th, aimed at enhancing their understanding of 2D and 3D shapes. The game features a user interface where students can interact with various shapes by clicking on them.

It uses object-oriented programming principles, I incorporated key concepts such as has-a-relationship, method overriding, method overloading, constructor overriding, inheritance, and upcasting to create a robust and extensible codebase.

# Technologies
Java concepts such as class, Object, Constructor, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Upcasting, Method Overriding, HAS-A Relationship, Interface

Tools : Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
